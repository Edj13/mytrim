MyTRIM
======

Three dimensional binary collision Monte Carlo library for sampling ion
collision cascades in materials.

The math behind this is based on the book
*"The Stopping and Range of Ions in Solids"* New York: Pergamon Press.
By J. F. Ziegler, J. P. Biersack, and U. Littmark (1985 (new edition in 1996)).

*MyTRIM* is fully tree dimensional and extendable to arbitrary sample geometries.

Examples
-----

### Energy deposition

Displacement events calculated by *MyTRIM*, colored by inelastic energy loss. The cube is 100nm on the side.

### Gas resolution

The video linked below shows ion cascades in a ceramic material knocking gas atoms out of a bubble inclusion.
